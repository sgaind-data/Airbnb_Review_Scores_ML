# 🏡 Exploring the Key Drivers of Airbnb Review Scores: A Machine Learning Approach with Sentiment Integration

**Author:** Sarika Gaind  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the key drivers of Airbnb guest review scores using **machine learning** integrated with **sentiment analysis**. Structured data (property & host attributes) is combined with unstructured guest comments to uncover factors affecting guest satisfaction.  

## 🔍 Methods & Models
- Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
- Sentiment Analysis with **VADER**  
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Random Forest (best performing model)
  - Decision Trees
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Linear Regression  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Positive guest sentiment strongly correlates with higher review scores.  
- Communication, cleanliness, and host responsiveness are major drivers of guest satisfaction.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, VaderSentiment, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
